## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a website made with HTML, CSS and JS. The CSS uses colour and font family variables, it includes media queries and is responsive. 
The mobile navigation includes a transitional blur to the background for easier reading of the navigation on mobile. Hovering over nav links provides an underline animation. 

## Optimizations

Could use more helper classes and make components more reusable. 

## Lessons Learned:

Using helper classes is an easier way of adding the same styling to many elements. Make sections reusable for easier reuse throughout website.
